                <h1>Proficiency</h1>
                I am proficient in .NET Core, especially ASP.NET Core and Blazor. I have done many projects in .NET and C#, and these are one of my strongest fields.
                <br/> <br />I started my coding journey in Visual Basic, mostly as a hobby project, and developed a few small VB6 applications, one being a small music player based on Windows API. I learnt Java soon in my 10th curriculum, and further
                learnt a lot of Java, making Java as the first programming language that I actively used OOPs concepts in. I am quite familiar with OOPs concepts and how Java does it, and started with GUI programming in Java. I learnt Java Swing, and
                JavaFX over the course. Since JavaFX is best done with maven, I picked up a lot of maven in this process. I have also experimented with C++, Kotlin, Python, and JavaScript.
                <br /> <br />Today, I am familiar with C# and the .NET Core ecosystem, Java, JavaScript, Web Designing, and good old C. You can take a look at my GitHub: cruciformhawk7.
